These might include staking protocols & products, DV client teams, DV tooling, node operators, educators, and community squad stakers." />
          <InfoUnit heading="Who is it for?" description="Any Obol Collective member can apply for retroactive funding, with their ecosystem impact and value-add being assessed based on KPIs such as TVL, code contributed, number of active DVs, etc." />
          <InfoUnit heading="How does it work?" description="Using the voting power earned from your contributions, you can vote for the projects to receive retroactive funding. Together, the community will determine which projects have created the most value for the ecosystem and can best put the funds to use decentralising Ethereum." />
